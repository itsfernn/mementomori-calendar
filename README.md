# Memento Mori Calendar

A simple visual calendar showing your weeks of life in an 80-year lifespan.

**Live demo:** https://itsfernn.github.io/mementomori-calendar/

Enter your birthday to see how many weeks you've lived (black squares) and how many remain (gray squares). Each square represents one week; each row of 52 squares is a year; each block of 10 rows is a decade.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser (or visit the link above). You'll be prompted for your birthday (YYYY-MM-DD). The calendar will render automatically. Use the "Reset birthday" button to clear stored data and start over.

## Details

- Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Stores your birthday in `localStorage`
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Deployment

Hosted on GitHub Pages at https://itsfernn.github.io/mementomori-calendar/. To deploy your own fork, enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings with source set to the `main` branch.

## Inspiration

Inspired by the "Memento Mori" philosophy—remembering mortality to live more intentionally.
